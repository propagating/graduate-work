    "In this case, the antithetic sampling method should not be expect to reduce variance. This is due to the restricts on the\n",
    "x values. This is due to the fact that the x values we use are pretty heavily skewed to one side of the uniform distribution.\n",
    "The scale of that does not change when swapping to antithetic sampling in our case, so we don't see any positive impact on variance.\n",
    "In fact, we see an increase in variance, but the difference is pretty minimal, so it's hard to tell if it's significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other scenarios, Antithetic sampling will typically reduce variance by helping to normalize the sampled\n",
    "values towards the mean of the distribution.\n",
